This is a simple program I created that uses a GUI for the user to input 2, 3 dimensional vectors.
The output will say the:
-Magnitude of the first vector
-Magnitude of the second vector
-Dot product of the two vectors
-The Cross Product of the 2 Vectors
-The Magnitude of the cross Product of the 2 vectors
-The Angle of the two vectors
